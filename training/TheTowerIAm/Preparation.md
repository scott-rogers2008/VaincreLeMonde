## Prepare every needful thing (Balance / Harmony / Virtue)

After having cleared the soil of your mind, you are now ready to further prepare it for all that you are going to grow there.
Perhaps according the to parable of the sower, seeds, and soil -- now that we've cleared our soil of weeds and destractions, now 
comes the harmony and balance, the nutrients and structure that make it soft and plyable so that the seed can grow.

Doctrine and Covenents 88:119 "Organize yourselves; prepare every needful thing; and establish a house, even a house of prayer, 
a house of fasting, a house of faith, a house of learning, a house of glory, a house of order, a house of God."

Doctrine and Covenants 38:24 "And let every man esteem his brother as himself, and practice virtue and holiness before me."


Doctrine and Covenants 121:45 "Let thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men, and to the household of faith, and let
virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God; and the doctrine of the 
priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven."
