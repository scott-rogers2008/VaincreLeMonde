# Separate from the world
There is certainly a lot of pressure to just follow the crowd, and currently, in this day and age, 
there is a lot of science and effort that goes into trying to "influence" "the masses". But to me it feels like
even the social influencers struggle to cater to the "least common denominator" or the most base emotions 
of humanity. I'd like to eventually use that research and science to lift and elevate, but helping raise 
others from where they are frequently requires more from the person being lifted than they want to give. Unfortunately
a lot of the science that goes into getting their support and influencing them, goes along with enabling their
weaknesses and encouraging them feel like the victim rather than shoulder the responsibilities of their own actions.

There are a lot of good reasons why the first step on road to true success is separation. I picked it because it 
had a more clear connection in my mind to separating the light from the darkness. But I thoroughly loved it when I
was looking for scriptures and talks to help me with it and found Elder Holland's Oct 2000 General Conference talk
https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2000/10/sanctify-yourselves?lang=eng and the scripture 
in Joshua 3:5 ***“Sanctify yourselves: for tomorrow the Lord will do wonders among you.”*** -- doesn't sound like the 
perfect first (next) step on ones iron rod path to a truly magical and magnificent future. It applies to other symbolic
first steps like Baptism, or first-next steps like partaking of Sacrament bread and water/wine (when I need a fresh start
type of feeling). And Elder Holland's talk was powerful with him talking about the need to be pure and ready in advance, 
so that when the storms strike you will be ready to help and bless those that are caught in it. It gave an excellent 
example of lightning striking when not expected, and someone (or multiple people) having been prepared and ready to
respond.

Now as it applies to general learning and study, separating oneself from distractions is an important part optimizing the 
effectiveness of study. That might be even more particularly true if you can do it all inside your own mind, even when in
an environment where you don't have control over all of external things trying to distract you.

I almost every, if not completely every, wise person exemplify this principle of separation.
