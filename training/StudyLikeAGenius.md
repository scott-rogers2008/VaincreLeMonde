## Study Like A Genius

In order to learn more effectively it's important to understand key elements that make learning effective. In 
[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYRmZdwi9mo) Justin Sung describes the follow key elements he helps learners to improve on.

**Deep thinking** --- building connections, integrating each new item into a network of things that you already know and questions that you
are hoping to answer.  From the Bloom’s taxonomy your taking each new bit of information in at  level 5 (or 6) Evaluate
[ *appraise, apprise, argue, assess, compare, conclude, consider, contrast, convince, criticize, critique, decide, determine, discriminate, evaluate,
grade, judge, justify, measure, rank, rate, recommend, review, score, select, standardize, support, test, and validate* (types of connections in your
mental network that you are building)] (or Create [ *arrange, assemble, build, collect, combine, compile, compose, constitute, construct, create,
design, develop, devise, formulate, generate, hypothesize, integrate, invent, make, manage, modify, organize, perform, plan, prepare, produce, 
propose, rearrange, reconstruct, reorganize, revise, rewrite, specify, synthesize, and write* ]) and breaking it down so that you can also Analyze [4],
Apply [3], Understand [2], and Remember [1]. These are covered more in depth in [This video from Justin Sung](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xqerXscTsE)

**Self-Regulation** -- (cue) <- (monitoring) -> (adjusting): This is learning to adjust my physical processes (like how I take notes) to help increase
my deep thinking. This can also be associated with recognizing the things that you have a habit of doing and improving those habits so that they are
more productive. It’s also associated with recognizing how well you hear, recognize, understand, and act on revelation so that you can adjust your
habits or processes to improve that connection to the divine. (Are you paying attention? And are you doing something about it?)

**Mindset** -- How you respond to discomfort, difficulty, and the idea of making mistakes. (You might even know something about growth vs fixed
mindset or open vs. closed mindset and still not realize how and when you fall into the fixed or closed mindset…) Realizing how wrong you are is
painful, it’s natural to recoil from that pain as opposed to embracing the opportunity to grow.  These are frequently taught as a binary (one vs.
the other) mindsets, however realizing that even these are something that you can grow and get better at is helpful in learning how to get better
at learning. And also something to monitor because as you get good at learning you may feel a bit of pride in your abilities and then seeing how
wrong you are will bruise that pride, so it’s important to monitor so that you can continue to grow this attribute. Growing this skill (improving
growth- and open- mindsets) gradually and managing the pain that you're willing to experience until you can eventually appreciate and embrace the
pain (and then take the next step and grow this attribute more) is an acceptable way to improve.

*(The above three are probably the most important.)*

**Spaced Retrieval** (or review) -- Practice using the things that you’re learning at intervals after studying to refresh the memories so that it
doesn’t decay as quickly.  And interleave it by addressing that same knowledge but from a different way or with a different application. (This is a common
tool that most people know how to use at least at a basic level.)

**Self-Management** -- How well you budget your time, prioritize your tasks, and focus your energy. This is tied into how well you can set and achieve goals.
(This skill set is covered more completely in the goal section).

*(I would also add)*

***Courage*** -- Because I’m coming from a perspective of incorporating revelation into the process, which isn’t something that most programs look at
or understand, it requires additional skills (*Humility* which can be easily integrated into self-regulation and mindset, *Faith* and *Courage* some of
which can come though facing the pain of having an open and growth mindset, and the love and friendship aspect that come through in trying to help
someone else learn.) Having the courage to act on ideas and impressions that you have (especially unique ideas), rather than saying they’re the
ones that are the experts, I'll just follow their well-worn path. This also ties into the mindset attribute because failure is an intricate part
of the game, and maybe I should separate it out as revelation as opposed to courage but it’s here as this for now. Revelation might also be incorporated
into the open mindset if one's mind is open to ideas even outside of the strict curriculum of what is being learned.

**Teach** -- One of the best ways to see the material from a unique perspective as well as confirm how well you know it is by trying to teach it to
someone else. This can be most easily done with a study group of others also learning at the same time. It can still have benefits even if you're just
teaching your cat (who won’t really care or learn) but it’s probably most effective if you can help someone who is having a difficult time learning but
who still wants to understand.

--------

It is recommended that you pick one to focus and improve on at a time while studying, and as you get better and more natural at each you'll see more
dramatic improvements in how quickly and effectively you are able to learn new things.
