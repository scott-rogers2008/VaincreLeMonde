# The Tower I Am
So I call this “The Tower I Am” with reference to the “I Am” that is one of the names of God, 
and also following somewhat the esoteric traditions of the Kabbalistic Tree of Life, that transforms 
the creation story into a path of understanding and gaining access to God. The idea being that there 
are hidden truths found in the Bible to unlocking ones divine connection with the Heavens, and 
achieving the miraculous.  I hope to use this as a core to a mind map (or several mind maps) to help 
me with all learning, my hypothesis being that studying eternal truths from the top down will help in 
the study of all things. In a way this is like my Jacob’s Ladder, and in climbing it I can find my 
way to God (and what I am meant to become) – the main distinction from the Tower of Babel being that 
I expect and rely on help from God at every step of the journey. I use the words “I Am” because I love 
how inviting all of the words of Christ are, being “The Way” and telling us to "be ye therefore perfect, 
even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect" (Matthew 5:48). The invitation being very clear that 
we are to become as much like God as we can, following His perfect example. So I think that constructing 
this Tower I Am is exactly what we need to be explicitly doing, and getting and giving as much help as 
we can to each other along the way.


My first favorite scripture that I encountered on my own was Abraham 1:2 paraphrased as: Abraham wanted to be like 
the great people that preceded him, desiring to “posses great knowledge, and to be a greater follower of righteousness, 
and possess a greater knowledge”. The path to this end is trying to accumulate as many virtues as I can and eliminate 
as many vices as possible, and continue that process well into the eternities. Virtues are hard to accumulate and vices 
are hard to part with. So with the mind maps and study necessary to create them, I want to also come up with better 
challenges, metrics, and goals to make sure I’m really moving forward.
