# The Close Personal Nature of Revelation

I would like to try to write this in a way that is unbiased and with enough academic rigor for anyone of any religious, ethnic, social,
  and economic background. I am, however, all too painfully aware of the Dunning-Kruger effect and the confirmation bias and how these can
  even taint our surveys and the way that we collect and analyze data. I also know that all efforts to rigorously prove the existence of God
  let alone the divine nature of His revelations have proven to be very difficult if not impossible. And being that any all-powerful
  being could, if he wanted, make such a thing indubitable, beyond even the possibility of doubt, shows us that if such a being exists,
  that He encourages us to question that existence. Since I’ll take it as a personal challenge, I will try to approach the topic from the
  philosophical argument of Descartes and try to avoid as many of the logical pitfalls that path presents as I am able. I will start with
  Descartes’ most basic kernel of truth, “I exist”, and while subsequent philosophers have proven the ability to doubt the extent of that
  existence, saying that we all could just be part of someone’s imagination, I’ll contend that we at least exist to that extent, even if
  the physical nature of our bodies might be only perceived, that we exist at least as a figment of some imagination. I believe that
  starting there gives us better access to what life is and what possible meanings it might have.

If there is a God, He doesn’t mind us questioning His existence, in fact if He exists then He certainly designed the world, the universe,
  in such a way that encourages us to find out for ourselves in a way that is uniquely and personally our own. We are all enabled to decide
  for ourselves if we don’t believe that there is any meaning to life or the universe, that it is all just random chance, and behave
  accordingly if we so choose. If there is a God then, what does this tell us about Him? Perhaps this is also something that He would
  have us decide on our own, but I think it’s clear that He doesn’t need recognition and/or praise. I think it also means that there is
  a strong possibility that the words, “I am a jealous God” aren’t accurately His.

I am certain that God does live and that He wants us to find him for ourselves. While His method might feel at times like an infinitely
  painful game of hide and seek or hot and cold, I believe that a deeper understanding of the way He is in and through all things our
  lives helps us to recognize life as one deeply personal conversation with God. We don’t have to see God in every aspect of our lives
  but when we do it helps us to see more fully what and who He is as well as giving us purpose and meaning in life. Regardless of our
  choice to see God in the details, our entirely frog’s-eye perspective gives us a detailed introspection of ourselves. I was introduced
  to this line of thinking through Hugh Nibley’s presentation Zeal without Knowledge (available in Nibley on the Timely and the Timeless),
  where he paints the structure of time, our minds, and how we perceive the world as the perfect test of priorities.
  
In a way not totally unlike Nibley, David Foster Wallace in a commencement speech for Kenyon College in 2005, 
  [This is Water](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCbGM4mqEVw) presented
  a very similar idea  *(If you have not read or listened to this in a while I recomend doing again.)*. The soupy, self-centered
  perception that we have, where we know that we exist but beyond that the existence of
  anything else is more murky might be compared to the water of life that Wallace presented to students and faculty at Kenyon College.
  Since we are at the center of all that we perceive, in a very real sense we are at the center of our own universe, and everything revolves
  around us. If or when there are children, teenagers, or even adults, that recognize that every experience they have had up until this point
  has constantly held them at the center of their universe, and they choose to act in a way that reflects that viewpoint, we need not be
  surprised. This is water, or the ubiquity of experience that we are all swimming in throughout our whole lives. Wallace recommends that 
  we take the time and effort to make the concious effort to see beyond the walls of our self-centered experience and try to empathise with others. 
  Though some of us are better at empathy than others, it does not come without effort and there remains an impenetrable barrier that we 
  cannot cross no matter how hard we might try.
  
I think I should pause here, and focus a little attention on a dangerous truth: that one can ignore God, humanity, others and just focus
  on what they want. With the mere realization that there are distractions in life, along with the realization that if one can overcome
  these distractions and focus, that person can get more out of life. This is an eternal truth that will benefit all that apply it
  (the dangerous truth being that you don’t have to believe in God or even any form of goodness to have this level of “success”).  “There
  is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world, upon which all blessings are predicated— And when we
  obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated.” (Doctrine and Covenants 130:20-21). The fact
  that a person is more likely to reach an objective through focus, and not being distracted, is a truth so fundamental that I don’t think
  I need any sources or references to back it up. And some people, realizing this truth have then asked, “So why do I need to believe in God?”
  
The dangerous aspect of the truth should also be acknowledged: people frequently don’t know what they need and what will bring them happiness.
  Some of the most unhappy people in the world are those that have found “success” by manifesting it, or focusing on what they want. I think
  that one of the reasons we need to recognize and acknowledge their accomplishments and their rewards is to help them and also to receive
  their help. This also helps us to get a more complete understanding of the God that doesn’t require them to believe in Him to have this
  measure of success.
  
Many of these people have realized that giving back to society has helped to ease their conscience. And many who have judged them, coveted
  their wealth or power, and tried to take it from them by other means have not proved to be any more righteous, successful, or happy. I think
  that we can take it as a sign from God that if God is all powerful and not corrupt, that he might actually want us to learn how to do the
  same: have power and/or money and stay free from corruption. I want us to do better at working together with that understanding, as opposed
  to believing that money itself is inherently evil.  I believe that both of the views: “if they are rich they must be good”, and “if they are
  rich they must be evil”, are erroneous and cause more harm than good.  I think that in the past thousands of years of Judeo-Christianity have
  shown the harms of both extremes of thought. I think that there are enough examples of both that we can choose for ourselves how we interact
  with this concept of greed and selfishness.

Along these lines I would like to proceed with Adam Smith’s “enlightened self-interest” and John Nash’s “Nash Equilibrium” as they apply to
  the human role of inspiration and revelation. In terms of the balance between altruism and supporting one’s self, Joseph Smith talked about
  giving in terms of “not running faster than one is able.” Having already set in place that there is a large extent to which God will not 
  stop us from following our own ambition as well as the clear truth that ambition does not bring happiness I think that the “Nash Equilibrium"
  is good next step, though not an adequate theologically based explanation of Jacob’s “And after ye have obtained a hope in Christ ye shall
  obtain riches, if ye seek them; and ye will seek them for the intent to do good—to clothe the naked, and to feed the hungry, and to liberate
  the captive, and administer relief to the sick and the afflicted.” (Jacob 2:19) It is, indeed, in our best interest as stated by Adam Smith
  to consider the well being of others, and as Nash proves, there is an equilibrium that improves our state over that of the selfish zero sum
  approach, when we not only consider but help others with their wants and needs. Jesus’s own words, “love your neighbor as yourself,” can be
  described as a divine equilibrium. While the Nash Equilibrium can be effectively used to optimize one’s wealth, we can look beyond that to
  the divine equilibrium to find a better balance and happiness in life, but this is a balance that one can only find in one’s personal
  interaction with God through the soupy mush of our own perspective and experiences. As Elder Eyering presented in his BYU speech
  [Blessings: A law of Increasing Returns](https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/henry-b-eyring/law-increasing-returns/) as we give first class and
  accept coach, our lives are increasingly more likely to be filled with joy and happiness as we lean into altruism even if that joy and
  happiness is delayed to a life after this life *(This is another talk that I highly recomend returning to frequently)*. He also states
  that giving so much that our spouses and families are miserable is probably not a good place to search for the proper balance and 
  encourages us to find that point of equilibrium for ourselves. Arthur C. Brook, a wonderful example of Catholic excellence, in 2009 shared
  with BYU students a talk entitled, [Why Giving Matters.](https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/arthur-c-brooks/giving-matters-2/) In this talk
  he shared his academic studies that proved that Rockefeller could indeed be correct when he stated that God gave him money, and that he
  wouldn’t be so rich if he didn’t give.
  
How do we find the balance of true and lasting happiness? How do we commune with God and pull down the very powers of heaven on our behalf? 
  If our lives are a constant personal conversation with God, what is He trying to tell us?
  
The idea that we all are having a deeply personal connection to God may be a revolutionary idea to some. In Doctrine and Covenants 121:33
  it states “As well might man stretch forth his puny arm to stop the Missouri river in its decreed course, or to turn it up stream, as to
  hinder the Almighty from pouring down knowledge from heaven upon the heads of the Latter-day Saints.” The idea that it could apply as well
  to any infidel as it would saint, might be a revolutionary idea to many Latter-day Saints. But the idea that members of the Church of
  Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints don’t hold a monopoly on goodness is not new. And while the term “Latter-day Saint” may be copyrighted,
  the church does do a lot to encourage everyone to know, feel, and understand that they everyone is a loved and cherished child of God,
  and that this means that He is doing his best to talk to and show his love to all of humanity. The idea that this is “the water” of our
  existence is not new, even if this particular presentation of it is new.
  
On the other side of this potentially revolutionary idea, is that it might not feel like God is revealing as much to us as He is to
  others.  At times when we desperately want something more concrete. The passive way that God is always there, constantly talking
  with us might feel at times like He’s not there or doesn’t care. And when we compare the way that God talks with us to the dramatic
  light show that Joseph Smith received, as was recorded as his first vision, we might feel slighted or less than worthy. I love how
  Elder Alexander Dushku approached these types of concerns in his April 2024 General Conference address “Pillars and Rays” and how
  if we recognize and treasure all of the small moments with God, they can add up to an amazing bright and shining pillar in our lives.
  
In terms of growing one’s ability for revelation, I also really appreciate Elder David A. Bednar’s April 2011 General Conference 
  address “The Spirit of Revelation” has similarities to Elder Dushku’s 2024 address. In the way Elder Bednar describes it, the light
  of our understanding grows gradually. Sometimes there are flashes of inspiration, where it’s like we can see everything all at once,
  but frequently that light grows more gradually.
  
And this personal aspect of revelation is highlighted in Elder D. Todd Christofferson’s April 2021 General Conference talk
  “Why the Covenant Path” especially where he talks about this “straight and narrow path” being so narrow that there’s just 
  one person, to make their individual and personal covenants with God.
  
<p>This personal connection with the heavens is closely connected to genius. The term genius comes from Greek, where it was
  the name of the spirit, or external entity, that inspires men to improve. And in mathematics and sciences in particular but
  in all studies in general there is an academic understanding of the “Aha!” phenomenon that has strong similarities to the LDS
  understanding of revelation. The general idea being that such things as getting the answers we want can’t be forced any more
  than a seed can be forced to sprout and grow, but we can prepare and make the conditions ideal for the seed. I believe that even
  the statement common in LDS culture, “what is given by revelation is best understood by revelation” can also be applied to every
  aspect of knowledge or skill. Since as I have proposed, all of life can be considered revelation, or a constant communication with
  God, the better we understand God and the way He is talking to us the better we can understand all things. As Moses said, 
  “Oh that all of God’s people would be prophets,” this appears to be the desire of God Himself. In Jesus' own words, 
  “Be ye therefore perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect” reveals that we are to use this personal connection with
  God to learn to become more like Him, divine. As we follow the directions He gives, as we covenant to follow his path and continue
  down that covenant path we understand Him better, receive great light and understanding in our lives, and are of greater help to those around us.
