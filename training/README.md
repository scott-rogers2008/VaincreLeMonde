# Training
As I'm trying to pull together those things that I think would be most important to learn, here is a collection of what I've come up with so far.
I think I've almost figured out how to build an agentic AI Graph-RAG that will help to help to keep all of these ideas more coordinated. 
I don't yet know how much of it I will be able to put into the src here but I'll try to do that as well.

Eventually I'm hoping that this all will be moved to a platform where it's easier to share and improve ideas and knowledge together.
