# (Working Title) Foundational Understanding
There are far too many things happening in the world that are trying to fragment and divide us as people. It saddens me that we cannot seem to get along better and so I've been looking for a Grand Unifying Philosophy that can help bring people together no matter where they are in life and no matter what they currently believe in. Wouldn’t it be wonderful to find a Grand Unifying Philosophy--one capable of lifting us all, regardless of how far we each may be from it, to someplace higher, perhaps even holier and more divine. It’s my firm belief that in the hierarchy of what truths matter most that this ultimate Grand Unifying Philosophy would probably be at the top, or perhaps should be. It wouldn’t be just another set of facts to memorize but a way of living and learning that improves life and learning. I might be tempted to just call this The Grand Unifying Philosophy, but I don't think I'm there yet. I’m still looking for the path that will lead me there. Hopefully eventually we can find it and reach it together. In order to get to this Ultimate Grand Unifying Philosophy I've been asking myself several questions, and perhaps these questions will help you as well, and us together: What would be The Most Important Thing to Learn (which I currently believe is this fundamental philosophy)? What is truly worth knowing? What do I know? What can I know? What does it matter? What is most needed in the world today? Am I even asking the right questions? Where do I start? ...
## Where to Start:
Recent research suggests that self-awareness is the strongest predictor of success, yet more than 80% of us overestimate our own ability to know ourselves.While this is often taught as a tool for high-level leadership, self-awareness should be a fundamental tool and responsibility for all humanity. I am all too painfully aware of the Dunning-Kruger effect and the confirmation bias and how these can taint even our surveys and the way that we collect and analyze data making it difficult to know almost anything for certainty. We are all prone to their effects and how they filter and taint our perceptions and ultimately our actions. Dr. Eurich’s studies into the “Introspection Illusion,” confirm that we aren’t as good as we think we are at knowing what our strengths are and knowing the limits of the strengths we have. Dr. Eurich suggests that the path to improved self-awareness is asking the right questions. Asking better questions. Not "Why am I this way?" but "What am I experiencing?" and "How can I know or learn more?"'
### The Kernel of Existence
To answer these, we must return to René Descartes’ foundational kernel: “I think, therefore I am.” While the exact nature and extent of our existence seems to be debatable, forming various families of thought, the fact that “I exist” is the most indisputable truth. Starting with this kernel of truth gives us better access to what life is and the possibility of meaning that it might have. Solipsism goes so far as to argue that it’s the only truly knowable thing. If the only thing I know is that "I exist," or if this is the truth that is most readily available, then the quality of my existence depends on the quality of my self-awareness.
### The Discovery of “Other”
Next in the hierarchy of undeniable truths is the existence of some universe or environment in which I exist. Whether that environment exists physically or only in my mind, there is something that I perceive as being a part of. There is at least a cognitive distinction from the “me” and the “not-me” even if that cognitive distinction might not feel as clear at some times than others. The “not-me” is not too difficult to contrast from the “me” because of the way that it resists and/or surprises “me”, there is something with which the “me” can interact with. This creates at the very least a perceived notion of “Me” and “Other”. While this might not be a part of solipsism or the ontological-idealism that has been argued by some, it seems to be a very basic truth, almost as undeniable as the truth of our own existence. 
## Why Start There:
Why enter this heady space of potential over-analysis or navel-gazing? Because our connection to actual knowledge is far more tenuous than we realize. It is dangerously easy to "know" things that aren't true. So dangerous, in fact, that it’s probable that we all suffer from thinking we know things that aren’t actually true.
Understanding the ego-centric predicament
This mushy perception, or subjective reality, is what Ralph Barton Perry calls the ego-centric predicament (https://archive.org/details/jstor-2011576/page/n1/mode/2up). It is what David Foster Wallace called the “water” of life, and gives rise to what he calls the default setting that he urges us to rise above (https://fs.blog/david-foster-wallace-this-is-water/). It’s important to be self-aware enough to realize the natural state that we are all born into and explore the concept of what one really knows until they get to this point and realize as Socrates that "The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing," and how very real that actually is. Or as Moses put it, “... Now, for this cause I know that man is nothing, which thing I never had supposed.” Moses 1:10. The fact that we are each stuck with our own individual Frog's-eyed, soda straw perspective in this ego-centric predicament makes understanding one another and learning in general difficult, but taking the time to recognize it helps.
### Overcoming the ego-centric predicament
We cannot hope to be successful in this life without first understanding the nature of life and humbly accept that it’s part of our nature to not know as much as we think we know. We need to understand the water, or the ubiquitous predicament that we are all living with, to better understand ourselves and each other. And in order to better understand ourselves and overcome our ego-centric predicament we need to also understand the “other,” both the environment that we live in and those we share it with. If I exist, and you exist, our Grand Unifying Philosophy must begin at the intersection of our shared reality. We need to work together to find the underlying truths of our shared universe, seeking underlying truths rather than individual truths clouded by faulty reasoning.
What does it Mean to Me (Why does it matter?):
Why does this perspective matter? Because I view this "bubble" of personal perception not as a prison, but as an intimate, personal conversation with the Divine. While proving the existence of God or the nature of His revelations is notoriously difficult, there is a profound lesson in that difficulty. If an all-powerful being exists, He could make His presence undeniable. That He does not suggest that He encourages us to question, to seek, and to find out for ourselves. We have the opportunity to take it as a personal challenge and try to know for ourselves if He is and who He is. He is yours to find.
### Finding Your God
We can start by equating 'God' with 'The It'—the totality of existence. Think of 'The It' as the sum total of all 'Other'. While we can doubt our own perceptions, it is impossible to ignore that something is happening. 'The It' is the floor we all walk on and the air we all breathe; it is the objective reality that persists whether we believe in it or not. Understanding this "It," and our relationship to it, is the most vital knowledge we can obtain. It is the foundation for understanding everything else, including ourselves and each other.
### Understanding Your God
If there is a God—a "He" integrally connected with "The It"—He has designed a universe that invites us to find our own way. He doesn’t mind us questioning His existence, in fact He certainly designed the world, the universe, in such a way that encourages us to question, to struggle, to figure things out for ourselves. He allows us the freedom to believe in random chance or divine purpose. For some people the assigning a God to this “It” of existence overly mystifies our existence, and there may be a fair amount of truth to that. There are probably people both historical and present that overly mystify God. There are certainly those that have and do use the idea of God for personal gain. Yet, if there is a God then, what does this tell us about Him? If He exists, He clearly does not demand cowering recognition; He is even willing to be doubted or even despised. This suggests that phrases like "I am a jealous God" may be misunderstood in modern terms. Perhaps "jealousy" refers to our attention.  Since we are stuck in this ego-centric predicament, if we focus only on our own shadows, we miss the productive conversation with 'The It' that life is meant to be. When religious texts speak of a 'Jealous God,' they are describing the tragedy of a person who is so absorbed in their own 'bubble' that they ignore the vast, unfolding reality of 'The It' around them. The 'wrath' isn't a lightning bolt; it's the natural consequence of being out of sync with the way things actually are. And “Jesus” is a way to not stay there. Whether one calls this “It” "The Universe," "The It," or "God," the moral requirement remains the same: rising above the self. I chose “God” to be the master of the personal bubble school room my perspective leaves me with for a lot of personal reasons that I cannot entirely explain here, so going forward I shall call “God” God, and use Him and He respectively.
## How can I use this philosophy:
The ego-centric predicament can be like black hole or void that is trying to suck us in. Every time someone does something that hurts or offends, whether or not they meant to hurt and/or offend, it causes a neurological stimulus to protect ourselves, and or those that we love, even if that action of protection also generates hurt or offense. It takes a great deal of effort to rise above the downward spiral of pain. But we have an opportunity to prove that we value the growth, or ability to learn and connect, more than decay and corruption of self-absorption found in only looking out for ourselves. In other words we have a chance to prove who we are, where our god or core beliefs are at. In fact I am certain that the way our existence is in this life is such that we don’t know anything as much as we know ourselves and the ‘God’ that we decide to follow. 

I’m certain that He is so completely and fully in and through all of the “other” with His infinite knowledge and power, that everything we experience is part of something that He is trying to say, is like a test to see if and how well we will listen. While His methods might feel at times like an infinitely painful game of hide and seek or hot and cold, I believe that a deeper understanding of the way He is in and through all things in our lives can help us to recognize who God is and what He wants from us and for us. We don’t have to see God in every aspect of our lives but when we do it can add a richness to life that one cannot experience any other way. It makes it easier to ask the “what” questions of introspection that help us to become better. Regardless of our choice to see God in the details, our entirely frog’s-eyed, soda straw perspective does give us a detailed introspection of ourselves. I was introduced to how our lives provide deep introspection of our own character through Hugh Nibley’s presentation at BYU of Zeal without Knowledge, where he paints the structure of time, our minds, and how we perceive the world as the perfect test of priorities, a way in which we are proved. How we choose to see others, how we choose to see the universe, how we choose to interact with others and the world around us, it all says a great deal about who we are choosing to be.

This idea—that our soupy, self-centered perception is actually a 'school room' for our character—is mirrored in both religious and secular thought. David Foster Wallace in his commencement speech for Kenyon College in 2005, This is Water presented a very similar idea. The soupy, self-centered perception that we have of life, gives us the opportunity to be selfish or rise above it. We can choose to understand with loving kindness the tendency others have for ego-centric behavior or to respond in kind holding tightly to our own selfish interests. If, or when, there are children, teenagers, or even adults, that have recognized that every experience they have had up until this point has constantly held them at the center of their universe, and they choose to act in a way that reflects that viewpoint, we need not be surprised. This is water, or the ubiquity of the experiences that we are all swimming in throughout our whole lives. Though some of us get better at empathy than others, it does not come without effort and there remains an impenetrable barrier that we cannot cross no matter how hard we might try. There are some things that we need to just leave to God and the Universe to handle and trust He knows what He is doing.

I think that this gives us an excellent start to better understanding ourselves and the world we live in. Dr. Eurich proposes that we find good friends or allies to ask questions about ourselves as an attempt to understand and correct our views of ourselves. I worry that this may lead to too much of an echo-chamber effect and not be as reliable as we may wish. It may be better if you can form a "team of rivals" as Abraham Lincoln did to stay better grounded. This means taking the opportunity each time we are hurt or offended to try and find the “advice” or whatever kernel of truth that might be there as a path to growth and becoming better.

## Conclusion:
This philosophy—treating life as an intimate conversation with God, the Universe, or simply the deepest parts of ourselves—offers a bridge across the gap of our own isolation. It provides a common ground where we can unify our beliefs and focus on the knowledge that truly matters.

However, living this philosophy requires relentless effort. The "default mode" of our ego is like a void; its gravity constantly pulls us down toward narrow-mindedness and away from the happiness and success we seek. To find truth, we must actively pull ourselves out of that void. We must strive to see the world through the eyes of others, ensuring we do not become the blind masters of our own delusions. If we live on "autopilot," we are drifting in the wrong direction. Mastery of life begins when we stop taking the path of least resistance and start the hard, beautiful work of truly knowing—and being known.


## Side-note:
Help me to come up with a good name for this philosophy.

There is a part of me that wants to call it Functional Communism, just to trigger those people that 
find Communism a personal trigger word, though I think calling it Jesus-Panentheism could trigger more people no matter which side of the
Jesus debate they are on.
