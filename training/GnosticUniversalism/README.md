# (Working Title) Gnostic Universalism
If this term already means something to you it might be the wrong term, as I think it might have been used for other things. 
I'm looking for a Grand Unifying Philosophy that can help bring people together no matter what they currently believe in and work 
together at building each other up. I also think in the hierarchy of what truths matter most that this ultimate Grand Unifying Philosophy 
would probably be at the top, or perhaps should be. I might be tempted to just call this The Grand Unifying Philosophy, but I don't think
I'm there yet. Hopefully eventually we can get there together. So in order to get to this Ultimate Grand Unifying Philosophy I've been asking myself
several questions. What would be The Most Important Thing to learn? What do I know? What can I know? What does it matter? What is most
needed in the world today? Am I even asking the right questions? Where do I start? ...

## Where to Start:
There are a number of studies that show that self-awareness is the strongest predictor of overall success, and that more than 80% of people 
highly overestimate their ability for self-awareness. It looks like it’s primarily only those in high-level leadership that are particularly 
made aware of this importance, I think that this should change. I am all too painfully aware of the Dunning-Kruger effect and the confirmation 
bias and how these can taint even our surveys and the way that we collect and analyze data making it difficult to know almost anything for 
certainty. Dr. Eurich’s studies into the “Introspection Illusion,” like the Dunning-Kruger model, are useful in knowing that we probably aren’t 
as good as we think we are at knowing our strengths and knowing the limits of our strengths. Dr. Eurich suggests that the path to improved 
self-awareness is asking the right questions. So I think this sounds like a good place to start: 'How can I know myself?' and 'How can I know anything?'

Along these lines it’s probably best to start with Descartes’ most basic kernel of truth, “I exist.”(my paraphrasing of his words). While the exact 
nature and extent of that existence seems to be debatable, forming various families of thought, that small kernel seems to hold true for everyone. 
I can’t see any value or reason for any person to doubt their own existence -- while there are some types of emotional abuse that might generate 
that kind of doubt, I hope that it doesn’t happen and isn’t studied. I believe that starting with this kernel of truth gives us better access to 
what life is and what possible meanings it might have, since it may very well be the only kernel of thought that is as undisputed as it is. Solipsism 
goes so far as to argue that it’s the only truly knowable thing.

I think that next in the list of undeniable truths is that there is some universe or environment in which I exist. I exist and there is some 
environment that I exist in that might or might not be wholly distinct from myself. There is at least a cognitive distinction from the me and 
the not-me in my thoughts and perceptions; the thoughts and perceptions that I have and experience are not too difficult to contrast from those 
entities with which I am having those experiences and at least appear to be separate from my cognitive thought and are apart from my perceptions and 
interactions with them. So there is at least a perceived notion of “me” and “other”.  While this might not be a part of solipsism or the 
ontological-idealism that has been argued by some, it seems to be a very basic truth, almost as undeniable as the truth of our own existence.

## Why Start There:
So why do I think it’s important to enter into this heady space of thought that might border on the side of over-analysis and navel-gazing? I’m 
hoping that it gives us a better insight into why and how our connection with actual knowledge is so tenuous:  why it’s so easy to not actually 
know what we think we know. 

This mushy existence of perception and interaction with “other(s)”, the fact that it is more easy than we may realize to doubt the value of others, 
is what Ralph Barton Perry calls the ego-centric predicament (https://archive.org/details/jstor-2011576/page/n1/mode/2up). It is what David Foster Walce 
called the water of life, and gives rise to what he calls the default setting that he urges us to rise above 
(https://fs.blog/david-foster-wallace-this-is-water/).  I think it’s important to explore the concept of what one really knows until they get to 
this point and realize as Socrates that "The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing," and how very real that actually is. Or as Moses 
put it, “... Now, for this cause I know that man is nothing, which thing I never had supposed.” Moses 1:10.

## What does it Mean to Me (Why does it matter?):
I think that this is the way we talk to God, the way we get to know Him. All efforts to rigorously prove the existence of God let alone the divine 
nature of His revelations to us have proven to be very difficult if not impossible. And being that any all-powerful being could, if he wanted, 
make such a thing indubitable, beyond even the possibility of doubt, shows me that if such a being exists, that He encourages us to question 
that existence, or at least to find out for ourselves. So we have an opportunity to take it as a personal challenge and try to know who He is. I think 
we can, no matter where are in life, start by equating Him with the It, the all of existence which turns out to be less doubtable than even the I. 
It turns out to be a lot harder to doubt that anything exists, since here we are having experiences, so there must be something even if it’s the 
something related to the illusion of everything. There is this It of existence that is very hard to ignore. And understanding It and our 
relationship to It is probably (and I calculate this probability to be so high so as to call it "certainly") more important than anything other
knowledge we can obtain.

If there is a God, a He that is so integrally connected with all of the It that It doesn’t operate outside of the bounds of what He allows, 
He doesn’t mind us questioning His existence, in fact if He exists then He certainly designed the world, the universe, in such a way that 
encourages us not only to find out for ourselves but also in a way that is uniquely and personally our own. We are all enabled to decide for 
ourselves if we don’t believe that there is any meaning to life or the universe, that it is all just random chance, and behave accordingly if 
we so choose. For some people the assigning a God to the It of existence overly mystifies our existence, and there may be a fair amount of truth 
to that. There are probably people both historical and present that overly mystify God. There are certainly those that have and do use the idea 
of God for personal gain. If there is a God then, what does this tell us about Him? Perhaps this is also something that He would have us come to 
learn on our own, but I think it’s clear that He doesn’t need recognition and/or praise, that He’s even willing to be hated or despised. I think 
it also means that there is a strong possibility that the words, “I am a jealous God” aren’t accurately His (at the very least, not the way those 
words are used today).

I am certain that God does live and that He wants us to find him for ourselves. In fact I am certain that the way our existence is in this life 
is such that we don’t know anything as much as we know God and ourselves. That he is so completely and fully in and through all of the “other” 
with His infinite knowledge and power, that everything we experience is part of something that He is trying to say. While His methods might feel 
at times like an infinitely painful game of hide and seek or hot and cold, I believe that a deeper understanding of the way He is in and through 
all things in our lives helps us to recognize who God is and what He wants from us and for us. We don’t have to see God in every aspect of our 
lives but when we do it can add a richness to life that one cannot experience any other way. It makes it easier to ask the “what” questions of 
introspection that help us to become better. Regardless of our choice to see God in the details, our entirely frog’s-eyed, soda straw perspective 
does give us a detailed introspection of ourselves. I was introduced to how our lives provide deep introspection of our own character through Hugh 
Nibley’s presentation at BYU of Zeal without Knowledge, where he paints the structure of time, our minds, and how we perceive the world as the 
perfect test of priorities, a way in which we are proved. How we choose to see others, how we choose to see the universe, how we choose to interact 
with others and the world around us, it all says a great deal about who we are choosing to be.

In a way not totally unlike Nibley, David Foster Wallace in his commencement speech for Kenyon College in 2005, This is Water presented a very 
similar idea. The soupy, self-centered perception that we have of life, gives us the opportunity to be selfish or rise above it. We can choose 
to understand with loving kindness the tendency others have for ego-centric behavior or to respond in kind holding tightly to our own selfish 
interests. If, or when, there are children, teenagers, or even adults, that have recognized that every experience they have had up until this point 
has constantly held them at the center of their universe, and they choose to act in a way that reflects that viewpoint, we need not be surprised. 
This is water, or the ubiquity of the experiences that we are all swimming in throughout our whole lives. Though some of us get better at empathy 
than others, it does not come without effort and there remains an impenetrable barrier that we cannot cross no matter how hard we might try. There 
are some things that we need to just leave to God and the Universe to handle and trust He knows what He is doing.

I think that this gives us an excellent start to better understanding ourselves and the world we live in. Dr. Eurich proposes that we find good 
friends or allies to ask questions about ourselves as an attempt to understand and correct our views of ourselves. I worry that this may lead to
too much of an echo-chamber effect and not be as reliable as we may wish. I may be better if you can to form a "team of rivals" as Abraham Lincoln did
to stay better grounded. And/or perhaps with your team try to reach unanimous consensus.

## Conclusion:
The philosophy of Life being an intimate conversation with God (or the Universe) (or just to better understand ourselves) is a philosophy that I think 
can help to unify beliefs and talk on common ground as well as improve our knowledge of those things that are truly most important.


## Side-note:
Help me to come up with a good name for this philosophy.

There is a part of me that wants to call it Functional Communism, just to trigger those people that 
find Communism a personal trigger word, though I think calling it Jesus-Panentheism could trigger more people no matter which side of the
Jesus debate they are on.
