# Gnostic Universalism and Revelation
If you are comming to this from what's written in the [README](/training/GnosticUniversalism/README.md) for this section, then it's probably 
not at all surprising that if our whole lives are a conversation with God, and he's using our whole universe and our interactions with it as His 
vocabulary to speak with us. This is the water of life, or that which is so ubiquitous that it encompases everything. So what more is there to say?
Or maybe better, What can I do to get better at understanding what the Universe is trying to tell me? How can I improve this conversation with God? and 
How does improving my conversation with God make a difference in my life?

## Dangerous Truths:
I think I should focus a little attention on the dangerous truth that one can ignore God, humanity, everything and just focus on what they want. With 
the mere realization that there are distractions in life, and along with the realization that knowledge that if one can overcome these distractions 
and focus, that such a person can get more out of life. This is an eternal truth that will benefit all that apply it (the dangerous truth being that 
you don’t have to believe in God or even any form of goodness to have this level of “success”).  “There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven 
before the foundations of this world, upon which all blessings are predicated— And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that 
law upon which it is predicated.” (Doctrine and Covenants 130:20-21). The fact that a person is more likely to reach an objective through focus, and 
not being distracted, is a truth so fundamental that I don’t think I need any sources or references to back it up. And some people, realizing this 
truth have then asked, “So why do I need to believe in God?” or “Why do I need to care about others?”

The dangerous aspects of the truth should also be acknowledged (both that it’s true and that it’s dangerous): people frequently don’t know what they 
need and what will bring them happiness. They frequently want the very thing that is causing or will cause them the most misery. Some are slow to 
recognize their own misery, through the help of self-medication and distractions. People are able to live in a diluted sense of happiness for a long 
time before realizing that none of it is actually real. Some of the most unhappy people in the world are those that have found “success” by manifesting 
it, focusing on just what they want, only to realize just how unfulfilling it is. I think that one of the reasons we need to recognize 
and acknowledge their accomplishments and their rewards is to help them and also to receive their help. This also helps us to get a more complete 
understanding of the God that doesn’t require anyone to believe in Him to have this measure of success. Life isn’t about what He’ll allow, it seems 
like He will allow almost anything and some people are bull headed enough to go down that dilutional path of “what can I get away with” because it can 
look deceivingly attractive, and it can look like they are indeed “getting away with it”. However, life and happiness are found in doing good, helping others, 
making lasting friendships that lift and encourage, but we have to overcome our ego-centric perspective and let go of so many things that we think we 
want or need. It’s hard.

Many of these people, those that have sacrificed their humanity for wealth, have realized that giving back to society has helped to ease their 
conscience. And many who have judged them, coveted their wealth or power, and tried to take it from them by other means have not proved to be any 
more righteous, successful, or happy. I think that we can take it as a sign from God that if God is all powerful and not corrupt, that he might 
actually want us to learn how to do the same: have power and/or money and stay free from corruption. I want us to do better at working together 
with that understanding, as opposed to believing that money itself is inherently evil.  I believe that both of the views: “if they are rich they 
must be good”, and “if they are rich they must be evil”, are erroneous and cause more harm than good.  I think that in the past thousands of years 
of Judeo-Christianity have shown the harms of both extremes of thought. I think that there are enough examples of both that we can choose for 
ourselves how we interact with this concept of greed and selfishness. I think that corruption is giving in to the ego-centric or default setting, 
and that overcoming this corruption makes for better lives, better communities, and better nations.

## How to create a better model for life:

Along these lines I would like to proceed with Adam Smith’s “enlightened self-interest” and John Nash’s “Nash Equilibrium” as they apply to success 
and achievement. In terms of the balance between altruism and supporting one’s self, Joseph Smith talked about giving in terms of “not running faster 
than one is able” (which I think means that it is ok and necessary to take care of oneself, especially when trying to help others). Having already 
set in place that there is a large extent to which God will not stop us from following our own ambition as well as the clear truth that ambition, 
wealth, and power do not bring happiness I think that the “Nash Equilibrium" is good next step, though it might not be an adequate theologically based 
explanation of Jacob’s “And after ye have obtained a hope in Christ ye shall obtain riches, if ye seek them; and ye will seek them for the intent to 
do good—to clothe the naked, and to feed the hungry, and to liberate the captive, and administer relief to the sick and the afflicted.” (Jacob 2:19) 
It is, indeed, in our best interest as stated by Adam Smith to consider the well being of others, and as Nash proves, there is an equilibrium that 
improves our state over that of a purely selfish zero sum approach. When we not only consider but help others with their wants and needs I believe we 
can reach a better, happier equilibrium. Jesus’s words, “love your neighbor as yourself,” can be described as a divine equilibrium. While the Nash 
Equilibrium can be effectively used to optimize one’s wealth, we can look beyond that to the divine equilibrium to find a better balance and happiness 
in life, but this is a balance that one can only find in one’s personal interaction with God through the soupy mush of our own perspective and experiences. 
As Elder Eyering presented in his BYU speech “A Law of Increasing Returns” as we give first class and accept coach, our lives are increasingly more likely 
to be filled with joy and happiness as we lean into altruism even if that joy and happiness is delayed to a life after this life. He also states that 
giving so much that our spouses and families are miserable is probably not a good place to search for the proper balance and encourages us to find that 
point of equilibrium for ourselves. Arthur C. Brook, a wonderful example of Catholic excellence, in 2009 shared with BYU students a talk entitled, 
“Why Giving Matters.” In this talk he shared his academic studies that proved that Rockefeller could indeed be correct when he stated that God gave him 
money, and that he wouldn’t be so rich if he didn’t give. The Nash Equilibrium can also give us some insight on the side of “altruism” that might be 
perhaps more like enabling than real, sustainable help and improvement. It might help us find a better equilibrium where we’re not giving so much that 
it is objectively detrimental to ourselves.

How do we find the balance of true and lasting happiness? How do we commune with God and pull down the very powers of heaven on our behalf? If our 
lives are a constant personal conversation with God, what is He trying to tell us?
