# Where to Start

Or maybe the title should be *Where to Start?*

It's a good question. Maybe I should start with a servey. Maybe one that asks things like "What do you think your are struggling with most?", "What are you most eager to improve in your life?", "What kind of help are you looking for?"

I had looked at a first step that tries to motivate with [InfinitePotential.pdf](/training/InfinitePotential.pdf) or something that might be more like a strong, basic footing like [TheClosePersonalNatureOfRevelation.md](/training/TheClosePersonalNatureOfRevelation.md) or something that outlines a whole path like [TheTowerIAm.md](/training/TheTowerIAm.md). I tried refining and focusing The Close Personal Nature of Revelation to a single kernel of truth that focuses on life as an intimate and personal classroom with God ([Foundational Understanding](/training/GnosticUniversalism/README.md))

Perhaps the first step might be different and personal depending on who the person is and what they are hoping to achieve. And the more I think about it the more I tend to appreciate this idea. Maybe as I get more people looking at this with me the better we can do at creating a more custom path that can hope to eventually be helpful for any that might find it.
