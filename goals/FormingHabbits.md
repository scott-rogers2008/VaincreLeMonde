## Habits: making and breaking -- in becoming who want to become.
The best way to break a bad habit is by forming a positive habit to take it's place. First let's start by looking at the habit loop.

[James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/three-steps-habit-change#:~:text=All%20habits%20proceed%20through%20four,the%20same%20order%20each%20time.) provides
this insight into how to start new habbits that stick.

The backbone of every habbit are these four stages:
- __cue__:</br>  The *Cue* triggers your brain to initiate a behavior. It is a bit of information that predicts a reward.
Because the cue is the first indication that we’re close to a reward, it naturally leads to a craving.
- __craving__:</br> The *Craving* are the motivational force behind every habit. Without some level of motivation or desire -- without
craving a change -- we have no reason to act. Cravings differ from person to person, but there are some fundamental commonalities in all of us
and how our bodies communicate to our brains.
- __response__:</br> The *Response* is the actual habit you perform, which can take the form of a thought or an action. Whether a response
occurs depends on how motivated you are and how much friction is associated with the behavior. If a particular action requires more physical
or mental effort than you are willing to expend, then you won’t do it. Your response also depends on your ability.
- __reward__:</br> The *Rewards* are the end goal of every habit. The cue is about noticing the reward. The craving is about wanting the reward.
The response is about obtaining the reward. We chase rewards because they serve two purposes: (1) they satisfy us and (2) they teach us. Rewards
close the feedback loop and complete the habit cycle.

Let's look at these from the perspective of foods and what we're in the habit of eating. The body has a naturally more intense reward system for sugars and salt,
both are essential for daily life functions. Training our minds and our bodies to get the callories and salt we need from healthy sources happens as we 
realize the rewards of having a healthy mind and body. We also feel the chemical reward systems our brains deliver as we succed at doing something difficult.

It's also important to realizing that one of the costs of the new self you are trying to create is the old self that you are comfotable with. You are
going to have to streatch beyond what is currently comfortable to grow into becomimg more than you have yet been. Creating new healthier habbits is more than
just doing something consistantly and frequently enough that it becomes second nature, it's learning to love it because of the better and healthier you are
because of it, it is making that new healthy habit a part of who you are.

Some studies suggest that it usually takes on average about 66 days to make a new behaviour become automatic. Stating that it becomes easier after the first 21
days and becomes more solidified in the following 90 days. Formalizing your desire by writing it down, and following up by tracking it and writing down your 
experience and progress with it can dramatically increase your chances of making that behaviour a permenent part of your life.
