## Where to Start: What should my first goals be?

Once you understand why goals are necessary, and some of the basic mechanics of setting and measuring goals ( 
[Setting and Reaching Goals](https://github.com/scott-rogers2008/VaincreLeMonde/blob/main/goals/SettingAndReachingGoals.md), 
[Forming Habits](https://github.com/scott-rogers2008/VaincreLeMonde/blob/main/goals/FormingHabits.md) )
we need to start working on those things that will help us make reaching goals easier. So let's look at some of the traits or habits that we may
need to start with.

### What kind of person do I need to become so that can reach my ultimate goals?

I found this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6QQDy1OUhE) helpful. In it Justin Sung mentions several attributes as examples: 
time management skills, task management & prioritization skills, focus & concentration skills, self-discipline. He also stresses the importance 
of being able to take a critical look at yourself, and realizing what it is that you need. I realized that this particular skill, self-evaluation, 
is probably the most difficult to do alone -- it is impossible (or at least nearly impossible) to see those things about yourself that you are blind
to, your own blind spots. And once you do see one of your own blind spots it is like the ground is removed right under your feet, which is very 
uncomfortable. Or it is like someone shining a bright light on your flaws, which is also uncomfortable. But one thing that is definitely needed is
to get outside of your own comfort zone, in order to become the amazing people that we need to be we need to sacrifice the person that we are comfortable
being.

Pick one or two to start with and use the [habit checklist form](https://github.com/scott-rogers2008/VaincreLeMonde/blob/main/goals/habit_goal_form.pdf)
to track your progress. Also pick an [achivement goal](https://github.com/scott-rogers2008/VaincreLeMonde/blob/main/goals/achivement_goal_form.pdf) like
learning a new language or building a new project ( you can look at my examples of what I'm currently working on https://github.com/scott-rogers2008/VaincreLeMonde/blob/main/goals/current as an example ). As you track your progress think about what attributes you might need to work on next
or shift to.
