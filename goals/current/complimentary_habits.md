## Habits to complement the goal of [making this into a product](https://github.com/scott-rogers2008/VaincreLeMonde/blob/main/goals/current/production_goal.md) by Christmas:
(using the [habit goal form](https://github.com/scott-rogers2008/VaincreLeMonde/blob/main/goals/habit_goal_form.docx))

### Motivation:
Similar to the motivation in the [associated achivement goal](https://github.com/scott-rogers2008/VaincreLeMonde/blob/main/goals/current/production_goal.md)
I want to create and test tools that inspire, facilitate, and track growth as my way of trying to help the world (or those in it that need it the most).

I'm changing this one up from what and how I was tracking it because of how inconvinient it is to track this here. ... While I do want to come
here periodically as I continue to update, improve, and solidify what it is that I want to and will do with this, puting my goals here was not
a productive way to get help with them. I did find that just having a box to check did tend to make me more likely to be more productive and 
since there are a lot of places to do that which are far more ideal than here. I'll simply list the 5 main categories, and general goals here
as well as more specific goals that will be easy for me to track in my personal journal.

### Habits & Frequency:
1. Improve physical health.  ( exercise at least 10min daily, and incorporate more vegetables into my diet daily )
2. Improve my knoledge. ( Work on the AI for my Discipulus Secretus Publishing, and study Korian -- both daily )
3. Improve my wisdom ( As part of the AI I'm builing, I want to create a personal encyclopedia ... I think this should be my next production goal. )
4. Improve my spirituality ( I'm going to pick a weekly virtue to focus on and put aditional study character development into that)
5. Improve my social interactions ( this is the one thing I'm less certain about, but Blake likes to help me out with this and I did start doing D&D with friends. )


So far tracking these in my journal is helpfull, and perhaps more helpful than just a check box because it does a better job of capturing 
the quality of action and not just a binary representation of accomplishment.
