## Habits to complement the goal of [making this into a product](https://github.com/scott-rogers2008/VaincreLeMonde/blob/main/goals/current/production_goal.md) by Christmas:
(using the [habit goal form](https://github.com/scott-rogers2008/VaincreLeMonde/blob/main/goals/habit_goal_form.docx))

### Motivation:
Similar to the motivation in the [associated achivement goal](https://github.com/scott-rogers2008/VaincreLeMonde/blob/main/goals/current/production_goal.md)
I want to create and test tools that inspire, facilitate, and track growth as my way of trying to help the world (or those in it that need it the most).

### Habits & Frequency:
1. Work on VaincreLeMond project daily
2. Study (goals or code) daily
3.

|        |        |         |           |          |        |         |

### Lessons learned & motivation after first month:
Maybe I should alter the form to make it easier to use with multiple goals.
