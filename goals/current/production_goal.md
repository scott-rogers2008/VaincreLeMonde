## Goal: Create Improvement tool to facilitate, track, and encourage growth.
(Using the [achivement goal template](https://github.com/scott-rogers2008/VaincreLeMonde/blob/main/goals/achivement_goal_form.pdf))

### Value / Mission / Roal (Why?):
There are too many people who have lost the ability to dream, that have been crushed by the weight of the world. I want to help them to concure their doubts, 
vanquish the world, and rise above it all like angels (or gods -- the devine beings they were ment to be).

### Goal (What? & When?):
Create a tool it inspire, facilitate, and track growth ---- by December 25, 2025

### <pre> Step (how?)                  :    Deadline (when?)    :   (check when completed) </pre>
- <pre>Create a basic outline of content                                           :   06/08/2025   : X
- <pre>Create a goal that I can track                                              :   06/19/2025   : X

- <pre>Add to web page calander, journal/blog, and other goal tracking interfaces  :   09/01/2025
- <pre>Add capability for users to interact, share and work on goals together      :   10/15/2025
- <pre>Make tool/web-page accessable and usable via mobile device                  :   12/25/2025  </pre>

### Leasons Learned:
(I haven't learned this lesson yet, but I know that each of the pieces aren't actually finalized and set in stone on their completion date, so
I have to figure out how to plan for flexability and growth durring the process and still stay on track -- or improve the track as I go.  
How should this form or tool change based on the need for more flexibility?)

I'm making progress but I'm not feeling all that confident.  It is nice having the goals to help me stay focused and relatively on track, just having the goals and checking off every day that I'm working does seem to help boost my productivity, but I'm still looking for more. Perhaps moving forward I need to switch one of my complimentary habits to feeling inspired. For that one I think I need something like a free form journal to log where I search and what I found for inspiration.
