## The Company

I think I finally understand how to get to the first stage, toward a company that can pay people to learn. (Though
now that I say it out loud in my head I realize that all companies realize that they can and should pay people to 
learn, even if they don't do a very good job of it.) For my company model, I want to make sure that the most important
things are taught first -- a framework for growth and learning -- and then the first profitable skill, communication -> publishing.

I think I finally know how to get my AI to use chunking, knowledge graphs, and dictionary based embeddings to help with
writing skills for books of all types. This will help speed up some of the processes and help with some of the more mundane 
and/or confusing steps, so that I and other authors can focus on all of the things that make the best of books.

While I can do each of those things: chunking, knowledge graphs, and dictionary based embeddings, and I'm certain that these things will
be useful in helping me to write better novels, I still need to learn a lot more about each of them and about writing. I also need to 
learn a lot more about building frameworks and structure. I think I now have solid foundational material, a good groundwork of knowledge
needed that frame and build everything from here. I know how to structure my time and plan out each of the steps to get to where I need 
to go next. And I think I finally understand better how frame my questions with enough background information so that I can ask for help
in ways that make it easier for others to give me the help I need.

For the foundation (of me and this that I am building) I know (or at least have a good idea of) where I am and what I'm starting with.
I have a descent vocabulary for describing or explaining how I hope to grow. I have tools and resources as well as the knowledge of
how to use them. I know how, when, and what to ask in order to receive divine help, and have a good idea of what that divine help will 
require of me. I also know something of creating the framework and structure so that I'm less likely to slip or mess up, and how to 
recover quickly when I do. And I know about how to listen and be flexible enough to deviate from plans when I need to.
