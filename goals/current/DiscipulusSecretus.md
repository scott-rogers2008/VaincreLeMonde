## The Company

I think I finally understand how to get to the first stage, toward a company that can pay people to learn. (Though
now that I say it outloud in my head I realize that all companies realize that they can and should pay people to 
learn, even if they don't do a very good job of it.) For my company model, I want to make sure that the most important
things are taught first -- a framework for growth and learning -- and then the first profitable skill, communication -> publishing.

I think I finally know how to get my AI to use chunking, knowledge graphs, and dictionary based embeddings to help with
writing skills for books of all types. This will help speed up some of the processes and take care of some of the more mundane,
so that I and other authors can focus on all of the things that make the best of books.
