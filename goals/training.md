## Setting and Reaching goals
“Without goals, and plans to reach them, you are like a ship that has set sail with no destination.”— Fitzhugh Dodson.

Setting goals provides clarity, motivation, a sense of direction, and a way to measure progress towards achieving desired outcomes, ultimately leading to increased focus, accountability, and a feeling of accomplishment when goals are reached. Since our ultimate aim is to reach the infinite potential within us, we need to set intermediate goals to help us focus on each next step needed to eventually get there. Especially since there are so many distractions and challenges to dislodge us and push us off course. There are a lot more challenges to successful achievement than just setting goals, but without even setting the goals all of those challenges become even more difficult to overcome.

### Goal Setting Matters
Studies show that people who set goals are 2-15 times more likely to achieve significant outcomes than those who don’t. 
Some studies even indicate that without goal-directed action, people cannot attain the values that make their survival 
and happiness possible. Additionally, writing down goals increases the likelihood of success by 42%, as it helps solidify 
intentions and creates a tangible reminder of what you’re striving toward. And monitoring your progress towards those goals 
in measurable and timely ways can double or triple their effectiveness.

Goal setting helps clarify what we want to achieve, making it easier to focus on priorities. Whether it’s personal growth, 
professional development, or improving relationships, having a clear target gives us direction and a sense of purpose. Goals 
also help break down larger aspirations into manageable steps, making daunting tasks feel achievable and relieves the sense 
of being overwhelmed or discouraged because of the size of a daunting task. For instance, rather than saying, “bring about 
world peace,” one can start with a goal like “call mom once a week” or “do a loving or charitable act daily” which provides 
clarity and structure and a place to start.

Another key benefits of goal setting and followthrough are the motivation and self-discipline the process provides. Defined 
objectives give us something to strive for, fueling persistence even when challenges arise. Goals also foster 
accountability—tracking progress helps us stay on course and identify areas for improvement. Success along the way also provides 
motivation and the forward momentum helps to carry us over the times that are tough. And self-discipline is improved in every step 
of the process.

The entire Universe and the God that created it want you to grow and they provide natural rewards such as dopamine (or the 
feelings of happiness that one gets as growth is realized). External rewards such as improved relationships and improved employment 
are also a natural consequence of growth and how well one can use goals to obtain consistent and predictable growth.

### How Goals are Set and Monitored Matters
If you want your goal to be something more than just a crazy wish, you’ll need a plan with measurable, timely steps. The plan needs 
to be flexible so that you can make the needed adjustments as you learn and grow. The plan also needs to be ambitious enough that you 
can feel the stretch, or burn -- but not so ambitious that no amount of motivation, self-mastery, and momentum will keep you from 
burning out. Don’t be afraid to make your goals and your plans uniquely yours. Personalize the hell out of it.

Setting habit goals, like daily study or exercise amounts, as well as achievement goals, like learning Spanish or losing 10 lbs., 
as complementary goals can dramatically increase the likelihood of achievement.

Even goals that have never been achieved by any recorded mortals can have real life benefits if the Plans, steps, and actions 
toward those lofty goals are based in an achievable reality, modified by experience, and progress is measured and tracked. Utilizing 
the benefits of SMART goal making we can make sure that at least our intermediary goals are achieved and we have measurements to 
track our progress toward the more lofty heights.

### Using the SMART system for goals
SMART goals are a framework for setting objectives that are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. This 
framework helps ensure that your goals are clear, attainable, and aligned with your overall objectives. Using goals that meet 
these criteria make them more useful for our growth and advancement. Let’s look at each aspect of this acronym. Combining these 
attributes into things other than goals, like prayers, meditation, study, and service can also improve their effectiveness as well.

_Specific_:
- A clear and well-defined objective that leaves no room for ambiguity. Think about the "what," "who," "where," and "why" of your
goal. For example the vague goal of “I want to be a better person” doesn’t provide enough focus and clear purpose to be as
effective as “I will do at least one act of kindness every day.” Or if you want to be more Christ-like, you can pick a Christ-like
attribute to work on each week, such as love, patience, gentelnes, or perhaps less thought of attributes like being more creative,
motivational, or decisive. This can add the specificity to give more focus and direction in how you achieve becoming more like Christ.

_Measurable_:
- Include quantifiable criteria or metrics that allow you to track your progress and determine if you've achieved your goal. Adding
  specificity can help in making things more measurable like the example above in wanting to be a better person. The goal “I want
  to be closer to God” could be more measurable if I look at how well I hear, recognize, understand, and follow the direction he provides.

_Achievable_:
- Ensure that the goal is realistic and within your capabilities, taking into account your resources, skills, and time. You may
  want to set an ambitious goal like “I want to be the smartest person in the world” or “the healthiest person in the world”
  (each which may or may not be actually achievable) but it’s important to break that down into short term goals like “I will
  study for four to eight hours a day” or “work out for an hour every day and only eat healthy foods” (you might also find those
  intermediate goals beyond your current capacity) so start where you are with “I’ll study (or work out) for 15 minutes each day”
  (this week and next week I’ll add 15 minutes to every other day, alternating between 15 minutes one day and 30 minutes the next day). 

_Relevant_:
- Align the goal with your overall objectives and values. It should be something that matters to you and contributes to your larger
  goals. Goals like “I want to master this video game” or “watch this entire season of this show” probably don’t align with other
  long term goals that you have like to do better at school or get a better job.

_Time-bound_:
- Set a realistic deadline for achieving the goal. This creates a sense of urgency and helps you stay on track. Giving your goals
  a sense of urgency and tracking them with time helps to bring more focus and attention to your goals, and you want to stretch
  yourself beyond your comfort zone, but you don’t want to cause more damage than good. For example if I can comfortably lift 25
  lbs. and struggle with 30 lbs. I don’t want to set a goal of lifting 500 lbs. each day this week, you need to stretch yourself
  enough so that your muscles will grow and not so much that you get injured and can’t move. Or even if you want to learn a new
  language, setting unreasonable timelines will only add to discouragement and not help growth. 

To these good attributes I would suggest that we all incorporate _flexibility_. As you start working toward your ultimate goal 
and gain experience of what works for you and what doesn’t make adjustments to your goals and plans to optimize your talents and 
traits. Also, _work with others_, helping others to achieve their goals will help you to better understand yourself, and their help 
will give you insight that might have otherwise been hidden from your view. Having someone that will hold you accountable as well
as holding someone else accountable both lead to higher self-accountability. One’s own commitment to goals and improvement is 
increased with improved teamwork.
