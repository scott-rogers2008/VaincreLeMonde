# VaincreLeMonde: improving the world one person at a time
Essays, trainings, goals, metrics, and self assesments to win at life.

Learning first how to hear/feel, recognize/distinguish the guiding influence of the universe, as well as how to understand and follow its guidance is the most important key to unlocking its unlimited power in our lives. The first step is to recognize that there are two basic streams of influence and direction: one of corruption, death, and darkness based on selfishness; the other of growth, life, and light based on love. (Or rather one of trying to consume more than you produce (darkness) vs one of trying to produce more than you consume (light).)

The basic understanding of choosing growth over decay is a good first metric in being able to see that you are growing and becoming something more. While choosing selfishness over love may look alluring, its ultimate destination is always corruption and decay. Along that same line of corruption appearing to be tempting is that it is frequently difficult to recognize the things that are really worth having (since there is often pain associated with growth and learning), but it is far better to become a better person by facing that pain than to become more corrupt by trying to avoiding it.

Happier and more productive lives are built on following the path of light, life, and love. Happier and more productive businesses are and can be built on learning how to better understand and adhere to its path. Happier and more productive communities and nations can be made by understanding and encouraging adherence to this path of light, life, and love.

### The Purpose of this is Open Source Learning
Until I can create a webpage that does better at facilitating open discussion and learning (where everyone is both a teacher and student and we learn and grow together), the format of github seems to be a good place to start this open learning model. The way that open learning with source code is facilitated with the git model is impressive, and I hope to grow from this base to something even more useful when it comes to more general knowledge and instruction. I do appreciate sites and learning programs like https://alison.com/, https://wisconsinliteracy.org/, and https://germanna.edu/degrees-programs/tuition-free-degrees (maybe I'll try to create a more complete list or list of lists with open and free learning) I would also like to improve on these wherever possible to promote a continuous open education. I would like this to eventually be the ultimate tool (or collection of tools) for continuous self/team improvement.

I also want to focus here on that learning that is most important. There might be some religious and philosophical debate on some of what is most important, but I don't want to get dragged into pointless debate over what is actually of real import. I want this to be as open, accessible, and accepting as is possible and of genuine help.

#### How to use this:
As you look through each of the folders and files and look at what is currently here to help with self/team improvement please give me feedback on what is helpful and what isn’t as well as ideas that you might have on your process for improvement and what tools you use, or would like to have that help you to grow. The way building and improving in github works is through the issue tracker: https://github.com/scott-rogers2008/VaincreLeMonde/issues feel free to add to the issues that are tracked if you have a free github membership or email me at scott.rogers2008@gmail.com.

Let’s work together to revolutionize the education system so that continual growth is always sought and not something to graduate from. Help continue the process of making it more available to more people. And help pull together those things that would make the world a better place for everyone in it.


I also want to focus here on that learning that is most important. There might be some religious and phylosophical debate on some of what is most important, but I don't want to get dragged into pointless debate ove what is actually of real import. I want this to be as open, accessible, and accepting as is possible and of genuine help.

### The title -- Vancre Le Monde 
I got from this talk (https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2022/10/47nelson?lang=eng) -- I think it sounds cooler in French.  And I love how the idea of conquering the world by first conquering one’s self is as old as time. Plato once said that the conquering of oneself was the first and most important victory. In Eastern traditions the conquering of oneself is the alchemy of soul and the ultimate path for mastering anything and found throughout all of Buddhism, Taoism, Confucius teachings, etc.  There isn’t a religion or school of thought that doesn’t recognize the importance of self-mastery. I think that this is a great foundation upon which we can all build together.
