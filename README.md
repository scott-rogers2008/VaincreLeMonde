Essays, trainings, goals, metrics, and self assesments to win at life.

Learning first how to hear/feel, recognize/distinguish the guiding influence of the universe, as well as how to understand and follow its guidance is the most important key to unlocking its unlimited power in our lives. The first step is to recognize that there are two basic streams of influence and direction: one of corruption, death, and darkness based on selfishness; the other of growth, life, and light based on love. (Or rather one of trying to consume more than you produce (darkness) vs one of trying to produce more than you consume (light).)

The basic understanding of choosing growth over decay is a good first metric in being able to see that you are growing and becoming something more. While choosing selfishness over love may look alluring, its ultimate destination is always corruption and decay. Along that same line of corruption appearing to be tempting is that it is frequently difficult to recognize the things that are really worth having (since there is often pain associated with growth and learning), but it is far better to become a better person by facing that pain than to become more corrupt by avoiding it.

Happier and more productive lives are built on following the path of light, life, and love. Happier and more productive businesses are and can be built on learning how to better understand and adhere to its path. Happier and more productive communities and nations can be made by understanding and encouraging adherence to this path of light, life, and love.
